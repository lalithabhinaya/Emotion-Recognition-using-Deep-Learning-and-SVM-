1. Change the Command line argument in all the shell file to match the location of dataset

	eg:       #!/bin/bash
                  python3 project.py 'SVM' '/home/CAP5627-3/data/Project1/Dataset2'
		  Change the last value of command line argument, make sure that for SVM1, RF1, you give the path of dataset1(till dataset folder
) and vice versa

		
2. Run each induvidual shell files for respective classifications,
		SVM1.sh -> SVM on dataset1
		SVM2.sh -> SVM on dataset2
		RF1.sh -> RF on dataset1
		RF2.sh -> RF on dataset2

3. For each shell file, the data is processed seperately, so it takes a while in producing the output.
